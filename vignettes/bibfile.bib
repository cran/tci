All such algorithms are similar to the extent that they use a linear pharmacokinetic model of the drug being administered to determine drug infusion rates to theoretically achieve and maintain plasma drug concentrations (setpoints) specified by the physician. Since the behavior of the pharmacokinetic model can be computed for any input, it should be possible to achieve regulation of the drug infusion rates that is flexible (i.e., the physician can interactively adjust the setpoint), practical, and analytically optimized; these objectives are realized by the algorithm described in this communication.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Target controlled infusion (TCI) systems are available commercially worldwide, except in North America. Existing systems target the plasma drug concentration, which may be less than ideal because the plasma is not the site of drug effect. The commonly accepted existing algorithm to target the site of drug effect results in high plasma concentrations, which may increase the acute hemodynamic effects of intravenous anesthetic drugs. METHODS: A novel mathematical algorithm is proposed for controlling the effect site concentration using a TCI device. The algorithm limits the peak plasma concentration, thereby slowing the onset of anesthetic drug effect but potentially ameliorating side effects. Simulations are used to examine the delay in time to peak effect for fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, remifentanil, and propofol when the peak plasma concentration is limited by the algorithm. RESULTS: The plasma overshoot required of the previously proposed algorithm to control the site of drug effect can be reduced by 60{\%} with only about a 20{\%} delay in the onset of drug effect. CONCLUSIONS: Concerns about the high plasma concentrations that result from targeting the effect site with a TCI device can be addressed by reducing the peak plasma concentration by as much as 60{\%} with only a very modest increase in time to peak effect.},

abstract = {Introduction: The analytical solutions to compartmental pharmacokinetic models are well known, but have not been presented in a form that easily allows for complex dosing regimen and changes in covariate/parameter values that may occur at discrete times within and/or between dosing intervals. Methods: Laplace transforms were used to derive ADVAN-style analytical solutions for 1, 2, and 3 compartment pharmacokinetic linear models of intravenous and first-order absorption drug administration. The equations calculate the change in drug amounts in each compartment of the model over a time interval (t; t=t{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-t{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) accounting for any dose or covariate events acting in the time interval. The equations were coded in the R language and used to simulate the time-course of drug amounts in each compartment of the systems. The equations were validated against commercial software [NONMEM (Beal, Sheiner, Boeckmann, {\&} Bauer, 2009)] output to assess their capability to handle both complex dosage regimens and the effect of changes in covariate/parameter values that may occur at discrete times within or between dosing intervals. Results: For all tested pharmacokinetic models, the time-course of drug amounts using the ADVAN-style analytical solutions were identical to NONMEM outputs to at least four significant figures, confirming the validity of the presented equations. Discussion: To our knowledge, this paper presents the ADVAN-style equations for common pharmacokinetic models in the literature for the first time. The presented ADVAN-style equations overcome obstacles to implementing the classical analytical solutions in software, and have speed advantages over solutions using differential equation solvers. The equations presented in this paper fill a gap in the pharmacokinetic literature, and it is expected that these equations will facilitate the investigation of useful open-source software for modelling pharmacokinetic data.},

abstract = {Target-controlled infusion (TCI) technology has been available in most countries worldwide for clinical use in anesthesia for approximately 2 decades. This infusion mode uses pharmacokinetic models to calculate infusion rates necessary to reach and maintain the desired drug concentration. TCI is computationally more complex than traditional modes of drug administration. The primary difference between TCI and conventional infusions is that TCI decreases the infusion rate at regular intervals to account for the uptake of drug into saturable compartments. Although the calculated infusion rates are consistent with manually controlled infusion rates, there are concerns that TCI administration of IV anesthetics could introduce unique safety concerns. After approximately 2 decades of clinical use, it is appropriate to assess the safety of TCI. Our aim in this article was to describe safety-relevant issues related to TCI, which should have emerged after its use in millions of patients. We collected information from published medical literature, TCI manufacturers, and publicly available governmental Web sites to find evidence of safety issues with the clinical use of TCI. Although many case reports emphasize that IV anesthesia is technically more demanding than inhaled anesthesia, including human errors associated with setting up IV infusions, no data suggest that a TCI mode of drug delivery introduces unique safety issues other than selecting the wrong pharmacokinetic model. This is analogous to the risk of selecting the wrong drug with current infusion pumps. We found no evidence that TCI is not at least as safe as anesthetic administration using constant rate infusions.},

abstract = {The incidence of Diabetes Mellitus is on the rise worldwide, which exerts enormous health toll on the population and enormous pressure on the healthcare systems. Now, almost hundred years after the discovery of insulin in 1921, the optimization problem of diabetes is well formulated as maintenance of strict glycemic control without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia. External insulin administration is mandatory for people with type 1 diabetes; various medications, as well as basal and prandial insulin, are included in the daily treatment of type 2 diabetes. This review follows the development of the Diabetes Technology field which, since the 1970s, progressed remarkably through continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), mathematical models and computer simulation of the human metabolic system, real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and control algorithms driving closed-loop control systems known as the “artificial pancreas” (AP). All of these developments included significant engineering advances and substantial bioelectronics progress in the sensing of blood glucose levels, insulin delivery, and control design. The key technologies that enabled contemporary AP systems are CSII and CGM, both of which became available and sufficiently portable in the beginning of this century. This powered the quest for wearable home-use AP, which is now under way with prototypes tested in outpatient studies during the past 6 years. Pivotal trials of new AP technologies are ongoing, and the first hybrid closed-loop system has been approved by the FDA for clinical use. Thus, the closed-loop AP is well on its way to become the digital-age treatment of diabetes.},

abstract = {Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is the use of intravenous agents for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. The most frequently used agent is propofol. Propofol effect is usually augmented with an opioid (e.g., remifentanil). Although it is possible to implement TIVA using pumps with the infusion rate controlled manually, the advent of pumps programed with pharmacokinetic information has facilitated use. The use of published pharmacokinetic parameter sets (referred to as models and often described by the principle author) allows the pump to determine infusion rates to maintain a certain plasma concentration (Cp) or effect site concentration (Ce). Covariate knowledge (e.g., weight, age) allows individualization of dose. There are limited data in the neonatal and infant populations. Common indications for TIVA techniques include children at risk for malignant hyperthermia, procedures with a high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, brief radiologic or painful procedures when rapid recovery is needed and frequent repeated anesthesia. However, use is spreading to other fields. Fears that children may develop propofol infusion syndrome during routine anesthesia have not eventuated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Automated systems can improve the stability of controlled variables and reduce the workload in clinical practice without increasing the risks to patients. We conducted this review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical performance of closed-loop systems compared with manual control. Our primary outcome was the accuracy of closed-loop systems in comparison with manual control to maintain a given variable in a desired target range. The occurrence of overshoot and undershoot episodes was the secondary outcome. METHODS: We retrieved randomized controlled trials on accuracy and safety of closed-loop systems versus manual control. Our primary outcome was the percentage of time during which the system was able to maintain a given variable (e.g., bispectral index or oxygen saturation) in a desired range or the proportion of the target measurements that was within the required range. Our secondary outcome was the percentage of time or the number of episodes that the controlled variable was above or below the target range. The standardized mean difference and 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes, whereas the odds ratio and 95{\%} CI were estimated for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-six trials were included. Compared with manual control, automated systems allowed better maintenance of the controlled variable in the anesthesia drug delivery setting (95{\%} CI, 11.7{\%}-23.1{\%}; percentage of time, P {\textless} 0.0001, number of studies: n = 15), in patients with diabetes mellitus (95{\%} CI, 11.5{\%}-30.9{\%}; percentage of time, P = 0.001, n = 8), and in patients mechanically ventilated (95{\%} CI, 1.5{\%}-23.1{\%}; percentage of time, P = 0.03, n = 8). Heterogeneity among the studies was high ({\textgreater}75{\%}). We observed a significant reduction of episodes of overshooting and undershooting when closed-loop systems were used. CONCLUSIONS: The use of automated systems can result in better control of a given target within a selected range. There was a decrease of overshooting or undershooting of a given target with closed-loop systems.},

abstract = {A computer controlled infusion device for propofol was used to induce and maintain general anaesthesia in 20 children undergoing minor surgical procedures. The device was programmed with an adult pharmacokinetic model for propofol. During and after anaesthesia, blood samples were taken for measurement of propofol concentrations and it was found that the values obtained were systematically over-predicted by the delivery system algorithm. New pharmacokinetic microconstants were derived from our data which reflected more accurately the elimination and distribution of propofol in a prospective study involving another 10 children.},

@article{Cascone2013,
abstract = {Remifentanil is a new opioid derivative drug characterized by a fast onset and by a short time of action, since it is rapidly degraded by esterases in blood and other tissues. Its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties make remifentanil a very interesting molecule in the field of 0anesthesia. However a complete and versatile pharmacokinetic description of remifentanil still lacks. In this work a three-compartmental model has been developed to describe the pharmacokinetics of remifentanil both in the case in which it is administered by intravenous constant-rate infusion and by bolus injection. The model curves have been compared with experimental data published in scientific papers and the model parameters have been optimized to describe both ways of administration. The ad hoc model is adaptable and potentially useful for predictive purposes.},
